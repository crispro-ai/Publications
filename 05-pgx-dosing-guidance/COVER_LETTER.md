Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript entitled "The CPIC Coverage Crisis: Automated Identification and Contextualization of Pharmacogene Variants Outside Clinical Guidelines" for consideration as an Original Article in *Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics*.

## Summary

This pilot validation study addresses a critical but underappreciated problem in pharmacogenomics implementation: the substantial gap between what clinical guidelines cover and what patients actually carry.

## Key Findings

Our analysis of 59 clinical cases with DPYD, TPMT, and UGT1A1 variants revealed:

1. **Only 17% of variants were covered by current CPIC guidelines** — the remaining 83% received no actionable recommendations in standard workflows

2. **100% concordance with CPIC guidelines** (10/10 cases, 95% CI: 72.2–100.0%) — demonstrating that automated implementation correctly applies existing evidence

3. **100% sensitivity for documented toxicity** (6/6 cases, 95% CI: 61.0–100.0%) — including one fatal case and one variant outside standard star-allele nomenclature

4. **Feasibility of automated ClinVar integration** — providing evidence-based context for the 83% of variants that guidelines ignore

## Significance

While pharmacogenomics is increasingly mandated before fluoropyrimidine treatment, the clinical reality is that most detected variants lack guideline coverage. Our system bridges this gap by automatically surfacing ClinVar evidence for uncovered variants, transforming "no guideline available" into actionable clinical context.

## Fit with Journal Scope

This manuscript directly addresses *Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics'* mission to advance the clinical translation of pharmacogenomics. Our focus on CPIC implementation, toxicity prevention, and real-world validation aligns with the journal's pharmacogenomics scope.

## Declarations

- This manuscript has not been published previously and is not under consideration elsewhere
- All authors have approved the submitted version
- No conflicts of interest to declare
- Data and code are available upon reasonable request

We believe this work will be of significant interest to your readership, particularly those involved in pharmacogenomics implementation, clinical decision support, and precision oncology.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
