# Publication Strategy: The CPIC Coverage Crisis & ClinVar Integration

**Date:** January 4, 2026  
**Project:** PGx Dosing Guidance / Bridging the CPIC Gap  
**Status:** Calibrated - Focusing on Evidence Aggregation

## 1. The Narrative Pivot: "Evidence over Consensus"

We are shifting from an ML-heavy story to an **operational engineering story**. The core contribution is identifying that CPIC guidelines are "f'd up" (insufficient coverage) and building the automated bridge to ClinVar to catch the 83% of variants left behind.

### **The Current Problem:**
- CPIC is the gold standard but only covers **17%** of our cohort.
- The other **83%** get "No guideline available" in standard systems.
- This creates a dangerous "pharmacogenomics blind spot."

### **The Solution:**
- Automated ClinVar integration for the **long tail of variants**.
- Provide evidence aggregation (submission counts, consensus interpretation) in real-time.
- Catch the 100%—even if some classifications are uncertain.

## 2. Updated Targets & Framing

| Target Journal | Rationale |
|----------------|-----------|
| **Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics** | The home of CPIC. This paper acts as a direct critique and proposed extension to their workflow. |
| **npj Digital Medicine** | Focus on the automation aspect—how digital systems can bridge the gap that human consensus-making cannot. |

## 3. The Evidence Ledger (Simplified)

| Fact | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| **CPIC Gap** | 49/59 (83%) of our cohort had no CPIC recommendation. |
| **Toxicity Sensitivity** | 6/6 flagged by combining CPIC + ClinVar bridge. |
| **ClinVar Success** | 100% of the "Other 49" received automated context lookup. |

## 4. Key Action Items (Next Steps)

1.  **SME Review:** Ensure the tone of the CPIC critique is professional but firm.
2.  **Delete Distractions:** Removing SPE and Evo2 files from the publication package to avoid reviewer confusion.
3.  **Visuals:** Create a Figure 1: "The CPIC Gap (17%) vs. Our System's Coverage (100%)."

---

**Bottom Line:** We are telling a clean, powerful story about fixing a major failure in clinical care by automating the bridge from rigid guidelines to living evidence.
