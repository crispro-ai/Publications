# PREPARE outcome-linked validation (DPYD/UGT1A1)

Generated: 2026-01-04T11:04:56Z

## Cohort
- Total patients: **563**
- Actionable carriers: **40**
- Nonactionable: **523**

## Requested step 1: sensitivity/specificity (actionability detection)
Confusion: `{'tp': 40, 'fn': 0, 'tn': 523, 'fp': 0}`

- Sensitivity: **1.000**
- Specificity: **1.000**

**Important:** These are based on the trial’s *definition* of actionable vs nonactionable (table-level). This is concordance with stratification, not patient-level prediction.

## Outcome separation (clinical)

### Actionable carriers (primary clinical signal)
- Control: 8/23 (34.8%)
- Intervention: 1/17 (5.9%)
- ARR: 28.9%
- RRR: 83.1%
- Fisher two-sided p: 0.0536

### All patients
- Control: 54/311 (17.4%)
- Intervention: 37/252 (14.7%)
- ARR: 2.7%
- RRR: 15.4%
- Fisher two-sided p: 0.422

### Nonactionable (negative controls)
- Control: 46/288 (16.0%)
- Intervention: 36/235 (15.3%)
- ARR: 0.7%
- RRR: 4.1%
- Fisher two-sided p: 0.904
