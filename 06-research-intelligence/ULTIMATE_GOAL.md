## 🔬 THE CORE MISSION

**Solve cancer by providing maximum clinical intelligence from minimum input.**

---

## 🎯 THE ULTIMATE GOAL

### **What We're Building**

A **Biomarker-Driven Research Intelligence Platform** that transforms a simple query + biomarker value into comprehensive, evidence-backed cancer research analysis.

### **The Vision**

```
User Input (Minimal):
  Query: "Why is CA-125 rising on carboplatin?"
  Biomarker: {disease: "ovarian_cancer_hgs", value: 850}

System Output (Maximum):
  ✅ Evidence: 1,000+ articles analyzed, mechanisms identified
  ✅ MOAT Analysis: Genomic findings, drug MoA, toxicity mitigation
  ✅ Nutrition: Personalized protocol based on biomarker burden
  ✅ Trials: Mechanism-fit ranked clinical trials
  ✅ Resistance: Cross-resistance analysis, alternative therapies
  ✅ Validation: Evidence tiers, confidence scores, provenance
```

### **The Core Principle**

**"Maximum output from minimum input"**

- **Input**: Query + biomarker value (or just query)
- **Output**: Comprehensive analysis that helps oncologists make better decisions
- **Goal**: Help solve cancer by providing actionable intelligence

   - Integrate all services into Research Intelligence
   - **Result**: Single endpoint: query + biomarker → comprehensive analysis

**Deliverable**: Unified system where biomarkers orchestrate all services

---

### **Phase 3: Validation & Proof (1-2 weeks)**

**Goal**: Prove the system actually helps solve cancer

1. **Build Validation Pipeline** (8-10 hours)
   - Generate 100 queries from existing data
   - Run Research Intelligence on all queries
   - Compute metrics (precision, recall, F1)
   - **Result**: Can measure system accuracy

2. **Run Validation** (4 hours)
   - Validate against 1,887 existing cases
   - Compute performance metrics
   - Generate validation report
