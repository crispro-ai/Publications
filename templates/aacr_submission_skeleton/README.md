# AACR Submission Skeleton (Reusable)

Drop-in template for creating an **AACR-style Methods/Systems + Reproducibility** submission bundle.

## Usage

```bash
cp -R publications/templates/aacr_submission_skeleton publications/<your_project>/submission_aacr
```

Then fill bracketed fields and replace placeholders.

## Folder expectations

- `figures/` — final figure images
- `receipts/` — logs + JSON receipts proving claims
- `data/` — scenario suites / configs used to generate receipts

## Claims discipline

- ✅ Claim deterministic behavior, provenance, reproducibility.
- ❌ Do not claim outcome benefit unless backed by outcome-labeled cohort benchmarks.
